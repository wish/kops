      synopsis: Update the annotations on a resource
      description: "Update the annotations on one or more resources. \n\n  * An annotation
        is a key/value pair that can hold larger (compared to a label), and possibly
        not human-readable, data.  \n  * It is intended to store non-identifying auxiliary
        data, especially data manipulated by tools and system extensions.  \n  * If
        --overwrite is true, then existing annotations can be overwritten, otherwise
        attempting to overwrite an annotation will result in an error.  \n  * If --resource-version
        is specified, then updates will use this resource version, otherwise the existing
        resource-version will be used.  \n\nValid resource types include: \n\n  *
        clusters (valid only for federation apiservers)  \n  * componentstatuses (aka
        'cs')  \n  * configmaps (aka 'cm')  \n  * daemonsets (aka 'ds')  \n  * deployments

        secrets are used to authenticate against Docker registries. \n\nWhen using
        the Docker command line to push images, you can authenticate to a given registry
        by running \n\n  $ docker login DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER --username=DOCKER_USER
        --password=DOCKER_PASSWORD --email=DOCKER_EMAIL'.\n  \nThat produces a ~/.dockercfg
        file that is used by subsequent 'docker push' and 'docker pull' commands to
        authenticate to the registry. \n\nWhen creating applications, you may have
        a Docker registry that requires authentication.  In order for the nodes to
        pull images on your behalf, they have to have the credentials.  You can provide
        this information by creating a dockercfg secret and attaching it to your service

      synopsis: Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources

      description: "Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or
        by resources and label selector. \n\nJSON and YAML formats are accepted. Only
        one type of the arguments may be specified: filenames, resources and names,
        or resources and label selector. \n\nSome resources, such as pods, support
        graceful deletion. These resources define a default period before they are
        forcibly terminated (the grace period) but you may override that value with
        the --grace-period flag, or pass --now to set a grace-period of 1. Because
        these resources often represent entities in the cluster, deletion may not
        be acknowledged immediately. If the node hosting a pod is down or cannot reach
        the API server, termination may take significantly longer than the grace period.
        To force delete a resource,  you must pass a grace   period of 0 and specify
        the --force flag. \n\nIMPORTANT: Force deleting pods does not wait for confirmation
        that the pod's processes have been terminated, which can leave those processes
        running until the node detects the deletion and completes graceful deletion.
        If your processes use shared storage or talk to a remote API and depend on
        the name of the pod to identify themselves, force deleting those pods may
        result in multiple processes running on different machines using the same
        identification which may lead to data corruption or inconsistency. Only force
        delete pods when you are sure the pod is terminated, or if your application
        can tolerate multiple copies of the same pod running at once. Also, if you
        force delete pods the scheduler may place new pods on those nodes before the
        node has released those resources and causing those pods to be evicted immediately.
        \n\nNote that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if
        someone submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their
        update will be lost along with the rest of the resource."

      description: "Edit a resource from the default editor. \n\nThe edit command
        allows you to directly edit any API resource you can retrieve via the command
        line tools. It will open the editor defined by your KUBE _EDITOR, or EDITOR
        environment variables, or fall back to 'vi' for Linux or 'notepad' for Windows.
        You can edit multiple objects, although changes are applied one at a time.
        The command accepts filenames as well as command line arguments, although
        the files you point to must be previously saved versions of resources. \n\nThe
        files to edit will be output in the default API version, or a version specified
        by --output-version. The default format is YAML - if you would like to edit
        in JSON pass -o json. The flag --windows-line-endings can be used to force
        Windows line endings, otherwise the default for your operating system will
        be used. \n\nIn the event an error occurs while updating, a temporary file
        will be created on disk that contains your unapplied changes. The most common
        error when updating a resource is another editor changing the resource on
        the server. When this occurs, you will have to apply your changes to the newer
        version of the resource, or update your temporary saved copy to include the
